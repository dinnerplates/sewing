### Materials
- 1 49.5cm #5 zipper & 2 zipper pulls
- 20 mm (optional for seam binding) grosgrain ribbon
- 14 cm of 25 mm grosgrain ribbon
- 3 sternum strap slidelocks
- 1 single adjust buckle for 20mm webbing
- 45 cm of 20 mm webbing
- 2 00 grommets and setting tool
- 30 cm of shock cord or other stretch cording
- 1 cord lock
- 1 bead or toggle to secure cordlock

### Instructions
1. Install grommets on C where indicated. Use a tailors awl to create the holes by stretching the fibers rather than cutting them with a punch, this substantially increases the strength of the grommet. To futher increase strength a patch of scrap ripstop can be used behind each grommet to help support them. If you do not have grommets button holes or eyelets can be sewn to install the cord.
1. Fold top of bottle pocket along dashed lines to create a rolled hem. Grommets should be on the outside of the pocket. Sew along bottom edge of hem with narrow zigzag or stretch stitch.
1. Install stretch cord by feeding through grommets, install a cord lock and bead or toggle to prevent cordlock from falling off. Sew to secure cord along seam allowances. 
1. Fold pocket along 45 degree lines right sides together between bottom tab and sides and sew or serge (recomended) sides of pocket C to bottom. Bartack the corners of the pocket to strengthen
1. Sew C to B wrong side of C to right side of B.
1. Sew dart on front right sides together.
2. Cut two 7 cm peices of 20 mm or 25 mm grosgrain and fold in half. Baste to front where indicated.
3. Cut zipper to 49.5 cm. 
4. Sew zipper to front aligning zipper ends to marks right sides together. Notch zipper as needed to fit to curve.
5. Sew zipper to side aligning zipper end to flat end seam allowance.
6. Bind zipper seam allowance if desired & topstitch zipper.
7. Install two zipper sliders onto zipper ends.
8. Cut two 5 cm peices of 20mm webbing and fold in half. Cut 35 cm length of 20mm webbing for front strap
9. Baste webbing loops and strap on back where indicated. If using non-releaseable sternum sliders install sliders prior to basting.
10. Sew front and side to back.
11. Bartack webbing loops and front strap in seam allowance
12. Bartack corners
13. Trim excess seam allowance and zipper and bind all raw edges if desired.
14. Sew a loop of 20mm grosgrain to bottle pocket where front strap crosses the pocket to support the bottle on the front webbing strap.
